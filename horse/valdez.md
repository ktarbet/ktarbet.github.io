## Karl's notes on: Lawrence Valdez 4H Clinic - August 6, 2016



Lawrence started by introducing himself and the ring steward.   Lawrence learned horsemanship from:  

  * His Dad -- big start at a young age.
  * King Ranch
  * Pat Parelli
  * Clinton Anderson. 

Working with a horse is like dancing with a partner -- you need to relate to being lead through a pattern. To get his horsemanship degree Lawrence was required to take three semester of dance classes to help relate to working with a partner.  You appreciate a good partner that can help lead and understand the problems with a partner that trips around.  This helps you see the horsese perspecting while being the leader.

The Clinic had these parts:

 * Showmanship
 * Equitation 
 * Reining

Throughtout the clinic Lawrence taught that this is all is all about painting a pretty picture. 

## Showmanship 
Showmanship is all done on the ground - no in the saddle.   According to Valdez You and your Horse must be well groomed.  You need to see the judge and the judge needs to see you. Showmanship is all about judging you and not much of the horse. 

Follow the quarter system when a judge inspects your horse.  You are always looking a the judge and move into the quadrant of the horse next to where the judge is.   Imagine a line extending along the back of the horse.   When the judge crosses that line you need to be moving with him -- so now you are dancing with your horse and with the judge.  When the judge is near the front of the horse you move to the opposite side -- when he is near the back of the horse you are on the same side (cross with the judge).  Lawrence was very helpful and had fun teaching the youth this dance.

some tips:

 * when you lead a horse start off with the food closest to the horse.
 * the smoother your dance with the horse the better.
 * always acknowledge the judge and wait to be acknowledged
 * wait for the judge to ack you with nod.
 * slow down, don't rush
 * your toes should be pointed toward the horses from shoulder.
 * if you horse is almost setup perfect don't fuss too much you may make it worse
 * pick your battles - it is ok to loose 1/2 point you can make up somewhere else
 * never hide behind your horse  (keep your eyes on the judge step away from the horse
 
## Equitation 

In Equaitation your horsemanship is being judged.  In this dance where you are on the back of a horse and you need to sit up in the saddle and keep that position.  When you stop keep your posture with hands down low and pull reigns into your belly button.

  Tips:
  * really listen to the judge  
  * do the pattern asked for nothing else nothing less
  * 
  * 

When the saddles were put on valdes started with lessons on mounting and dismounting.   

## Reining

 How do you paint a pretty picture in reining?   

  tips:
   * When doing a multi part pattern make each manavoer and individual.

If the Judge doesn't see it you don't get credit.  If the judge sees bad you loose points.
