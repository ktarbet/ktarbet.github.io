## Karl's notes on: Lawrence Valdez 4H Clinic - August 6, 2016



Lawrence started by introducing himself and the ring steward.   Lawrence learned horsemanship from:  

  * His Dad -- big start at a young age.
  * King Ranch
  * Pat Parelli
  * Clinton Anderson. 

Working with a horse is like dancing with a partner -- you need to relate to being lead through a pattern. To get his horsemanship degree Lawrence was required to take three semester of dance classes to help relate to working with a partner.  You appreciate a good partner that can help lead and understand the problems with a partner that trips around.  This helps you see the horsese perspecting while being the leader.

The Clinic had these parts:

 * Showmanship
 * Equitation 
 * Reining

## Showmanship 
Showmanship is all about painting a pretty picture.  How do you paint a pretty picture?  According to Valdez You and your Horse must be well groomed.  You need to see the judge and the judge needs to see you. Showmanship is all about judging you and not much of the horse.

Follow the quarter system when a judge inspects your horse.  You are always looking a the judge and move into the quadrant of the horse next to where the judge is.   Imagine a line extending along the back of the horse.   When the judge crosses that line you need to be moving with him -- so now you are dancing with your horse and with the judge.  When the judge is near the front of the horse you move to the opposite side -- when he is near the back of the horse you are on the same side.  Lawrence was very helpful and had fun teaching the youth this dance.

some tips:

 * when you lead a horse start off with the food closest to the horse.
 * wait for the judge to ack you with nod.
 * slow down, don't rush
 * never hide behind your horse  (keep your eyes on the judge)

  Tips:
  
  * do the pattern asked for nothing else nothing less
  * make each

Some hard truths.

If the Jude doesn't see it you don't get credit.  If the judge sees bad you loose points.
