Lawerence Valdez was in Boise today.  He and John Garro love teaching the youth of 4H groups.  Toays clinic was at the 10 mile riding club in South West Bosie.   The clinic was similar to taking your horse to fair, but you are encouraged ask questiions at any time.

## Showmanship at Halter 

Showmanship is about Show, Show, Show.   

### Your appearance

Ladies hair should be in a bun.  Gentelmen should wear a vest or Jacket.   everyone Hat, long sleve shirt, boots, belt.

### Your Horse

If you horse has a short maine it should be banded on one side.  coat should be shiny.  Be careful with show sheens on the back because in the next class you could fall off easy.   Horse must be clean, includes nose, trim wiskers, baby oil around nose, eyse (be careful not too much) .  Briday path no more than length of ear, except arabain or mini horse could have longer bridal path.  

###  Show Show Show

You need to be crisp clean, alert, you need to act like your horse is worth a million dollars.   Show the whole time you are in the arena -- you never know when the judge is looking.    Hold down the lead shank 6-8 inches.  Not right on the halter because that is not safe and against the rules.


Setup your horse but don't mess with small things.  "I want you to fix it" if the hoof is off by 1 foot or more.  +1 point for fixing it.  

Always move horse away from you.   In showmanship you don't touch your horse.  don't touch in practice or you will touch in the show.  You can be disqualified if you touch your horse.  Muscle memory -- as you practice you will show.

The judge may mess with your horse, such as tuck forlock under halter to see if you will fix it.  Fix if immediataly, while judge is watching,  don't wait.  This is the case where you can touch the horse -- fix , fix, fix. smooth/erase what the judge did.  the judge may be trying to 'bust' you.

### Tack

Tack can make a tie breaker.  Create the pretiest picture.  Buy a leather halter, you can add silver honcho to dress it up  Invest you will do better.  Bottom line it tells the judge you are Serious.   No Spirs in Showmanship.
 
###   On the Horse

Red Ribbon in the tail says "Back off --- My horse will kick!"

Know Where to Be, When to Be, and Why. 

don't post in wester equatation.    Reigns are above of before the saddle horn.   chin back, toes up, heels down. eyes up.  "Horse goes where you are looking,  I promise"

When starting to lope use the leg closest to fence to get the correct lead.  

Reigning is about Balance and looking pretty.  For example left circle matches right circle, distance and speed the same on both circles.  If big and fast left circle, then big and faset right circle.

pivioting with hind feet, front feet cross.


Lawerence had a wrapup and asked the 4H kids what what they learned or what was the "ah ha moment".
