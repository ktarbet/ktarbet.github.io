## Showmanship at Halter 

Showmanship is about Show, Show, Show.   

### Your appearance

Ladies hair should be in a bun.  Gentelmen should wear a vest or Jacket.   everyone Hat, long sleve shirt, boots, belt.

### Your Horse

If you horse has a short maine it should be banded on one side.  coat should be shiny.  Be careful with show sheens on the back because in the next class you could fall off easy.   Horse must be clean, includes nose, trim wiskers, baby oil around nose, eyse (be careful not too much) .  Briday path no more than length of ear, except arabain or mini horse could have longer bridal path.  

###  Show Show Show

You need to be crisp clean, alert, you need to act like your horse is worth a million dollars.   Show the whole time you are in the arena -- you never know when the judge is looking.    Hold down the lead shank 6-8 inches.  Not right on the halter because that is not safe and against the rules.
