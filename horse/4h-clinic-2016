## Karl and Tiffany's notes on: Lawrence Valdez 4H Clinic - August 6, 2016


This was an awesome clinic!  There was so much learning we decided to write down the key parts. 


Lawrence started by introducing himself and the ring steward.   Lawrence learned horsemanship from:  

  * His Dad was a trainer -- big start at a young age.
  * King Ranch
  * Pat Parelli
  * Clinton Anderson.
  
Lawrence Valdez is a professional horse trainer and Judge. He lives in Rupert Idaho.
  
Working with a horse is like dancing with a partner -- you need to relate to being lead through a pattern. To get his horsemanship degree Lawrence was required to take three semester of dance classes to help relate to working with a partner.  You appreciate a good partner that can help lead and understand the problems with a partner that trips around.  This helps you see the horse's perspective while being the leader.

The Clinic had these parts:

 * Showmanship
 * Equitation 
 * Reining

Throughout the clinic Lawrence taught that this is all is all about painting a pretty picture. The overall picture is a BIG deal. Equitation and showmanship are traditionally more so judged on the rider/handler. But you and your horse must be a good team to achieve a great picture.

## Showmanship 
Showmanship is all done on the ground - none in the saddle.   According to Valdez You and your Horse must be well groomed.  You need to see the judge and the judge needs to see you. Showmanship is all about judging you and not much of the horse. Your number must be visible.

Follow the quarter system while a judge inspects your horse.  You are always looking at the judge and move into the quadrant of the horse next to where the judge is.   Imagine a line extending along the back of the horse.   When the judge crosses that line you need to be moving with him -- so now you are dancing with your horse and with the judge.  When the judge is near the front of the horse you move to the opposite side -- when he is near the back of the horse you are on the same side (cross with the judge).  Lawrence was very helpful and had fun teaching the youth this dance.

Some tips:

 * When you lead a horse start off with the food closest to the horse.
 * The smoother your dance with the horse the better.
 * Always acknowledge the judge and wait to be acknowledged
 * wait for the judge to acknowledge you with nod.
 * slow down, don't rush
 * Your toes should be pointed toward the horses from shoulder.
 * If you horse is almost setup perfect don't fuss too much you may make it worse
 * pick your battles - it is ok to lose 1/2 point you can make up somewhere else
 * Never hide behind your horse (keep your eyes on the judge step away from the horse)
 * turn into the horse so the horse is moving away from you
 * stand far enough in front so he can see your whole horse.
  
 
## Equitation 

In Equitation your horsemanship is being judged.  In this dance you are on the back of a horse and you need to sit up in the saddle and keep that position.  When you stop keep your posture with hands down low and pull reigns into your belly button.

  Tips:
  * Really listen to the judge  
  * do the pattern asked for nothing else nothing less
  * When you are asked to change direction listen carefully if you are to continue at the same walk or trot.
  * When changing direction turn your horse into the center (this keeps you eye on the judge)
  * Backing up a horse keep your eyes forward on the judge or ring steward.
  * reverse means to reverse and stop   reverse at the trot, walk, etc means to keep gait at the reverse and keep going
  * Legs back, shoulders back, head up,toes in,  etc - should be seen at all times watch posture in transitions
  * when backing pull to your belly button keep posture
  * if riding with one hand keep your hand on your thigh or in a fist in front of your belly button
  * he's used incorrect lead for tiebreaker at anohter fair so practice both- well trained horses can do both.
  * take your time make smooth transitions 
  * no jerking on reins be fair to your horse
  * you can't take 1-2 more steps after told to stop because it looks smoother.
  * to stop don't lean back but you can drop your spine
When the saddles were put on Valdez started with lessons on mounting and dismounting.  He showed a trick for shorter riders -- you can scrap a little pile of sand to give you the two inch boost you may need to reach your stirrups.  When a competition is very close a Jude may use something like mounting and dismounting to find first place.

## Reining

 How do you paint a pretty picture in reining?  Have nice balance when riding a pattern. Always start to the right unless told otherwise.  If the first half of a symmetrical pattern is a large circle make the second half the same.  Watch for lead changes they are required in western riding.  Make that change in the center or middle of the pattern.  Correct a wrong lead. Slow and right is better than fast and wrong. 

  Tips:
   * be very calculated
   * When doing a multi part pattern make each maneuver and individual.
   * The horse goes where you are looking.
   * Never touch the horse - you don't pet/pat your horse in competition
   * in a bridle don't reach forward with your free hand.
   * Set your horse up for success if he can't do flying lead change don't try and fail.  He would rather see the simple lead change.
*If the Judge doesn't see it you don't get credit.  If the judge sees bad you lose points.
