    Gvf solves an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)
    describing Gradually Varied Flow (GVF) in a circular
    channel.  An ODE solver using the Bulirsch-Stoer method
    is used.  


    Right click in the table to add new pipe sections

    Known problems:
    1) Depths near or at critical depth (Froude number =1) will crash
    or stop the solution.
    2) Adding pipe sections only works as appending sections, insert doesn't work.
    3) Program may become unstable when a solution fails.   
    4) If an error occurs computing Normal Depth the Pipe diameter is
    used (full pipe) for depth


    Program Instructions:
    Beginning and ending pipe diameters are
    usually the same.  An untested feature allows entering changing
    pipe diameters to model transitions.  Beginning and ending
    x-coordinates specify a range to compute the GVF profile.
    Typically when multiple pipe sections are entered, the ending
    x-coordinate will equal the next pipes beginning x-coordinate.
    The beginning depth can be either zero (0) or a positive value.
    However the first pipe must have a reasonable beginning depth.
    If a depth of zero is entered this pipe's beginning depth will
    come from the solution of the previous pipe's ending depth.
